# Stock Analysis using VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In this module we focused on visualizing and analyzing a series of market actions for Steve's parents, who wanted to invest in the stock market of companies that produce green energies. Using Microsoft's programming language called "Excel VBA" or "Visual Basic for Applications" a series of codes were made to guide the investor to make the best decision statistically in order to not only be able to make money by investing in the stock market, but also also help the environment by investing in these  green energy companies.

## Results
In the stock market, 12 companies were studied throughout the years 2017 and 2018 to help the investors decide on which company should they invest. The companies studied were the following:
- Atlantica Yield ("AY")
- Canadian Solar ("CSIQ")
- Daqo New Energy ("DQ")
- Enphase Energy ("ENPH")
- First Solar ("FSLR")
- Hannon Armstrong ("HASI")
- Jinko Solar ("JKS")
- SunRun ("RUN")
- SolarEdge ("SEDG")
